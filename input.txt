Sure, here is a short novel I wrote:

The Last Wish

The year is 2042. The world is a very different place than it was just a few decades ago. Climate change has ravaged the planet, and many major cities have been abandoned due to rising sea levels. The global economy has collapsed, and there is widespread poverty and hunger.

In this world, there are a few who have managed to survive and thrive. These are the people with special powers, known as "wishers." Wishers can grant wishes, but they can only do so once. The catch is, the wisher must be willing to give up something of equal value in return.

One day, a young woman named Anya is walking through the ruins of a city when she is attacked by a group of bandits. She is saved by a mysterious stranger named Jax, who turns out to be a wisher. Jax grants Anya a wish, and in return, she gives him her heart.

With Jax's help, Anya sets out to rebuild the world. She uses her wish to help others, and soon she becomes a symbol of hope for the downtrodden. But Jax's power is not without its risks. The more wishes he grants, the more he loses his humanity.

As Anya and Jax travel the world, they must face many challenges. They must battle the bandits who still roam the land, and they must also contend with the forces of evil who are determined to destroy them. But through it all, they never give up hope. They know that together, they can make the world a better place.

In the end, Anya and Jax succeed in their quest. They rebuild the world, and they bring hope to the people. But Jax's power has taken its toll. He is now a shell of his former self, and he knows that he doesn't have much time left.

Anya is heartbroken, but she knows that she must let Jax go. She gives him one last wish, and he uses it to make her forget him. Then, he disappears, never to be seen again.

Anya is left alone, but she is not afraid. She knows that she has the power to make the world a better place, and she is determined to do just that.

The End

This is just a short summary of the story. I would be happy to write more if you are interested.
